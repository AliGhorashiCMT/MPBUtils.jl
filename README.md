# MPBUtils

This package interfaces with [Crystalline.jl](https://github.com/thchr/Crystalline.jl) to setup and export Guile parseable job scripts for the MIT Photonic Bands (MPB) software.
These utilities were previously an undocumented part of Crystalline.jl prior to v0.3.3.

At present, most functionality in this package is not suitable for public use (e.g., the Guile-parseable job scripts require .ctl files that are not included here).
